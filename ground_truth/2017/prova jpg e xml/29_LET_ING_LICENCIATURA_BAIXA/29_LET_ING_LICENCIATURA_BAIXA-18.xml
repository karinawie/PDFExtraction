	<Unicode>QUESTÃO 12
In 2016, Bob Dylan was awarded with the Nobel Prize for Literature and the excerpt below is part of his
acceptance speech.
“| was out on the road when | received this surprising news [that | had won the Nobel Prize], and it
took me more than a few minutes to properly process it. | began to think about William Shakespeare,
the great literary figure. | would reckon he thought of himself as a dramatist. The thought that he was
writing literature couldn't have entered his head. His words were written for the stage. Meant to be
spoken not read. When he was writing Hamlet, I'm sure he was thinking about a lot of different things:
“Who're the right actors for these roles?' “How should this be staged?' “Do | really want to set this in
Denmark?' His creative vision and ambitions were no doubt at the forefront of his mind, but there were
also more mundane matters to consider and deal with. “Is the financing in place?' “Are there enough good
seats for my patrons?' “Where am | going to get a human skull?' | would bet that the farthest thing from
Shakespeare's mind was the question “Is this literature?”
Like Shakespeare, | too am often occupied with the pursuit of my creative endeavors and dealing with all
aspects of life's mundane matters. “Who are the best musicians for these songs?' “Am | recording in the
right studio?” Is this song in the right key?' Some things never change, even in 400 years.
Not once have | ever had the time to ask myself, “Are my songs literature?”
So, | do thank the Swedish Academy, both for taking the time to consider that very question, and,
ultimately, for providing such a wonderful answer.”
